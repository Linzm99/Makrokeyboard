## Code

The Code for the Makrokeyboard was written for the Arduino IDE, which supports the Atmega32U4 as Arduino Leonardo/Pro Micro. For uploading "Arduino Leonardo" or "Arduino (Pro) Micro" should be selected as Board. The COM Port selector will show the Atmega32U4 as well.
Hint: If your Chip wasn't flashed with a bootloader you have to do that first. This requires soldering a ISP Connector and flashing via (for example) Arduino ISP. [Tutorial from Leon Anavi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToMrxnRNHM4)
